# Task

This is a fresh project ( no code ).

We are in specifications period.

I already made the following BMAD workflows:
- Brainstorm
- Product Brief
- UI-UX
- Architecture

We brainstorm on new ideas/changes to operate on the current state. Then I will use `/bmad:bmm:workflows:correct-course` to integrate the idea we brainstormed.

## Idea 1: SubAgent view

In Session plugin, when agent do someting, we see the bubble but its from the orchestrator log file.

When we click on it, it open a new tab focused on the agent conversation. So the events list and all details are centered on this specific conversation. It behave as anything else and we can even send it an input. However it should be differenciated visuallement to recognise that we are in a subagent tab. Maybe the color of the tab or the icon in the tab. We can also click on a subagent action from the events list to open its tab. It works when an instance is running as well, clicking on the currently running subagent will open its conversation from the log file and update it to see it live.

Technically its very similar to loading the main conversation, we simply load a conversation file different ( the one from the agent ), but all the features and display etc.. remains the same. The feature to display a conversation should be compatible with one or the other without having to make any conditional, if possible. We will figure out later when we have material to explore and test on .claude folder.
