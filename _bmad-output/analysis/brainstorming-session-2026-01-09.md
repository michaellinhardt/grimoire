# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Teazyou
**Date:** 2026-01-09

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Grimoire - Electron-based AI Workflow Manager (an app for spawning Claude Code instances, managing workflows, visualizing conversations, and making AI tools accessible)

**Goals:**
- Review coherence of the overall concept
- Identify potential problems or gaps
- Explore alternative/better solutions
- Finalize the brainstorming document

### Context Guidance

_Key focus areas from request.md: Electron app architecture, Obsidian-inspired UX with ribbon/panels, Claude Code integration via custom .claude folder, MVP features (loading screen, CC conversation reader), workflow management for non-technical users._

### Session Setup

_Approach: AI-Recommended Techniques - customized suggestions based on concept review goals._

---

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Concept validation and critical review (not pure ideation)

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Question Storming (Deep):** Reveals blind spots by generating critical questions before seeking answers.
2. **Six Thinking Hats (Structured):** Systematic 360-degree evaluation from six perspectives.
3. **Anti-Solution (Wild):** Stress-tests the concept by asking "How could we make this fail?"

---

## Technique Execution Results

### Technique 1: Question Storming

**Questions Generated by Category:**

**User & Market:**
- Who exactly is the "non-technical user"?
- What barrier would make a non-technical user run away?
- How is this APP different from competition?
- Why would someone use Grimoire instead of just installing Claude Code directly?

**Technical & Architecture:**
- How does Grimoire update the workflow state from the LLM answer?
- What tools or MCP to build to ensure all features?
- How to optimize the context window by delegating workflow orchestration to the APP?
- How to read Claude Code session real time?
- How to generate and save metadata about each Claude session spawned?
- What happens when Claude Code updates and changes its file structure?
- Is redirecting HOME directory reliable across Mac/Windows/Linux?

**Business & Scope:**
- How to monetize if everything is local and open source?
- Is monetization even a goal, or is this a portfolio piece / personal tool first?
- What's the minimum viable scope for YOU to find it useful daily?

**Key Discovery:** The app is primarily for personal use. "Non-technical users" is a potential future market, not the MVP target.

---

### Technique 2: Six Thinking Hats

**White Hat (Facts):**
- Primary user = Teazyou (personal tool first)
- Claude Code spawn is reliable (validated)
- Non-technical users = v2 concern
- CC conversations stored in JSON at `~/.claude/projects/`

**Red Hat (Emotions):**
- Excited: Using it for personal tasks, centralizing workflows
- Nervous: It might not be good enough to replace simple CLI usage
- Skeptical: Will it be easy for non-technical users? (but acknowledged as not important for MVP)
- Curious: Will the prompt system compensate for orchestration instructions, making it token efficient?

**Yellow Hat (Benefits):**
- Personal Agent Library - Create and run agents with minimal knowledge
- Create Tools - Recurring workflows via namespaces
- Sharable Workflows - Community library potential
- Improved Context Window - App manages recurring operations
- Text to Workflow - Natural language to JSON workflow builder
- Edit Prompt - Obsidian-like MD editor for prompts
- Centralize Results - All outputs saved, searchable, exportable
- Better Claude Code UI - Dissociated tool usage, readable info
- Reusable Workflows - Run same workflow repeatedly (training course use case)
- Local First - Obsidian philosophy, your data, your subscription

**Black Hat (Risks):**
- Not good enough: CLI remains faster/easier, even creator doesn't use it
- Scope monster: 10+ major features, each is a project
- Two products: Workflow builder and CC UI fighting for attention
- Maintenance burden: CC updates could break integrations
- Complexity creep: "Non-technical" and "node builder" may conflict

**Blue Hat (Process):**
Core tension: Grimoire must be FASTER than CLI for actual daily tasks or it dies.
Critical question: What's the ONE feature that makes you open Grimoire instead of terminal?

---

### Technique 3: Anti-Solution

**How to Make Grimoire Fail:**

**Death by Friction:**
- Require 5 clicks to start a session
- No keyboard shortcuts
- Slow startup time (Electron bloat)
- When opening for a quick question, it's not immediate

**Death by Complexity:**
- Implement too many features too fast, nothing works well
- UX has too many options, overwhelming
- Require JSON knowledge for basic tasks

**Death by Quality:**
- Buggy, slow, crashes
- Makes mistakes with files and namespaces
- One lost session = permanent trust loss

**Death by Broken Promises:**
- Data saved online (breaks local-first promise)
- "Non-technical" but error messages are stack traces

---

## Idea Organization and Prioritization

### Core Themes

**Theme 1: Core Value Proposition**
- Reusable workflows + centralized results
- Context window efficiency through app-managed orchestration
- CLI wins if Grimoire is just "nicer" not "necessary"

**Theme 2: MVP Scope**
- It's for YOU first
- Avoid two products fighting internally
- Feature bloat = nothing works well

**Theme 3: Trust & Reliability**
- True local-first (Obsidian philosophy)
- File operations sacred
- Stability > features

**Theme 4: UX Principles**
- Keyboard-first navigation
- Sensible defaults
- Progressive disclosure
- Fast startup
- Direct path to "ask question"

### The Critical Filter

> **"What task is IMPOSSIBLE in CLI but EASY in Grimoire?"**

**Answer: Reusable Workflow Library**
- Define a workflow once, run it whenever needed
- Training course example: same workflow, 100 manual runs
- Results centralized by workflow/namespace
- "Obsidian for workflows" - not batch processing

---

## Prioritization Results

**Top Priority: Reusable Workflow Library**

| What You Want | What You Don't Want |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Save workflow, run it again later | Automated batch processing |
| One-click to start familiar workflow | Complex queue management |
| Centralized results from repeated runs | Batch orchestration features |

**Secondary Priority: Quick Question Mode**
- Prevent CLI escape hatch for simple tasks
- `Cmd+N` → instant new session, cursor in prompt
- Or CLI bridge: `grimoire ask "question"`

---

## Robustness Checklist

**Must Have:**
- [ ] Quick question path < 3 seconds from app open
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for all core actions
- [ ] File preview before write
- [ ] Works offline, no account required
- [ ] Human-readable errors
- [ ] Sensible defaults (no required config)

**Must Avoid:**
- [ ] Feature bloat before core is solid
- [ ] Online data when promised local
- [ ] Forced complexity for simple tasks
- [ ] Slow startup time
- [ ] Stack trace errors shown to user

---

## Action Plan

### Immediate Next Steps

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | Define what a "workflow" contains (prompt, persona, context, target folder) |
| **2** | Build workflow save/load (JSON or SQLite) |
| **3** | Simple workflow picker UI → spawns CC with that config |
| **4** | Results land in namespace, findable later |

### Technical Questions to Resolve

- Real-time session reading method
- State sync between app and LLM
- Metadata storage format
- Claude Code update resilience

---

## Session Summary

**Key Achievements:**
- Validated that Grimoire is a personal tool first, not a product for "non-technical users"
- Identified the core differentiator: Reusable Workflow Library (what CLI can't do)
- Generated comprehensive failure map as robustness checklist
- Clarified MVP scope: workflow library + quick question mode

**Critical Insight:**
> Grimoire must be faster than CLI for your actual daily tasks, or it dies. The escape hatch "I'll just use CLI" is the existential threat.

**The Grimoire Philosophy:**
- Obsidian for AI workflows
- Local-first, your data, your subscription
- Stability over features
- Reuse over rebuild
