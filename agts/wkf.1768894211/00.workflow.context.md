# Workflow Context: Architecture Decision Alignment Review

**Request:** Review propagated architecture decisions for alignment and completeness
**Purpose:** Verify that spawn-child-decisions.md was correctly propagated into project docs
**Method:** 3 parallel sub-agents each review one modified file against source decisions
**Acceptance Criteria:** Each agent produces a report identifying any misalignments or omissions

## Source Document
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/spawn-child-decisions.md` (9 architecture decisions)

## Modified Documents for Review
1. `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
2. `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`
3. `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md`

## Expected Outputs
- `01.architecture-review.report.md`
- `02.prd-review.report.md`
- `03.ux-review.report.md`
