We are going to study a solution similar to my project: opcode.sh

First you load architecture.md prd.md and the ux-design-specification.md so you have full context

I want you to make different research.

- List all UI/UX "feature"
- List all backend / AI "feature"

- Investigate the code
  - What we have in common, how they implemented it
  - Would it be better for Grimoire to use this method ?

- Search people opinion, what are the top 3 compliments from people and the top 3 complains

- Search anything else that would be good to integrate in our app

For each research use a sub agent to protect your context, ask the sub agent to write a report file about its research that you can then read
